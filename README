NAME
    DateTime::Format::XSD - Format DateTime according to xsd:dateTime

VERSION
    version 0.4

SYNOPSIS
      my $str = DateTime::Format::XSD->format_datetime($dt);

DESCRIPTION
    XML Schema defines a usage profile which is a subset of the ISO8601
    profile. This profile defines that the following is the only possible
    representation for a dateTime, despite all other options ISO provides.

       YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH:MI:SS(Z|[+-]zh:zm)

    This module is a subclass of DateTime::Format::ISO8601, therefore it
    will be able to parse all other ISO options, but will only format it in
    this exact spec.

SEE ALSO
    DateTime, DateTime::Format::ISO8601, The XML Schema speficitation.
